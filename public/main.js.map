Do you want me to drop you off back home?\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tIt was my turn to protest this time, \"I've been waiting for weeks to\n\t\twitness you catch a fish, especially after your stories! I wouldn't\n\t\tmiss it for a thing.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tConsidering he had rest his case, he jogged on and we reached the\n\t\triverbed in silence. He called it a river, but it had a greater\n\t\tresemblance to a shallow stream to me. The water was as peaceful as the\n\t\tview of a patchy sky from inside a thicket of Matricarias. I watched\n\t\thim in silence pouncing upon the radiantly bronze Talapias and scaly\n\t\tgreenish Perches, but they appeared too swift for his immature\n\t\tattempts. After hours of fruitless effort, he made his way back to me.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tHe slouched down, panting he said, \"No luck today. I couldn't see a\n\t\tsingle fish. I suspect They are behind this.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"You describe them as having supernatural powers.\" I said sniggering,\n\t\t\"Besides I noticed plenty making their way&#8230;away from you.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tHe scowled and seemed on the verge of retorting but got tensed the\n\t\tmoment we heard movement on the opposite the bank. After a few seconds,\n\t\ta small calf emerged from the bushes and started drinking merely.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"I've got to try again.\" he said springing to his feet while his eyes\n\t\twere still on the animal on the other side.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Huh? What happened all of a sudden? You have all the time in the world\n\t\tto learn this, why can't we just get our lunch the usual way?\" I\n\t\tdemanded half-exasperatedly, making his way towards the water.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tAs he looked back at me, I could see the gold in his eyes, \"That is the\n\t\tthing&#8230;I don't have the time. I'm running out of it, and too fast\n\t\tactually.\" And with that, he was back in the water.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- What is Aging&#8230;he could never answer properly.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tIt was late in the evening that we began our way back home, which would\n\t\thave been empty handed and on an empty stomach if not for the young\n\t\ttannish hare on the way. We could see all sorts of life returning to\n\t\ttheir shelters with their loved ones. I saw him linger around a pair of\n\t\tgrey striped rock-buntings flutter around their nest, watching them\n\t\tlongingly.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"So why an unwavering need to learn fishing?\" I asked, breaking his\n\t\treverie. \"You have plenty of, more efficient might I add, ways of\n\t\tstaying well fed.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tWe started traveling again, and he took some time before answering. \"My\n\t\tkind is not fond of the water. We're not like that elephant you saw. I\n\t\ttold you, fishing was one thing my brothers couldn't do. Only my sister\n\t\tcould, but that wasn't a big deal since women are known to hunt anyways\n\t\tin our culture. As I grow up, I want to make sure that I can be a\n\t\tbetter King than they could have been.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tBy the time we reached home, the grounds were covered in starlight. We\n\t\talways had a hard time reaching the top of the hill, but K reasoned\n\t\tthat if it took him such difficulty, no one else would be able to make\n\t\tthe climb and it was apparent that my safety was his greatest priority,\n\t\talthough he was reluctant to admit it so blatantly.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Why is it so important for you to be the King? Can't you just live\n\t\tlife as it is right now?\" I questioned while he prepared to sleep,\n\t\tlaying me at my usual spot by the boulder covering majority of the\n\t\tentrance so I could view the sky outside through the crescent window.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"It is in my destiny. Or it was in my eldest brothers to be more\n\t\taccurate, but it is of no use reminiscing over the past now\" he added\n\t\tas an afterthought. \"But if they were here, I could spend a lot more\n\t\ttime showing you around. Maybe we could even have been able to explore\n\t\tthe other side of that river.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tI knew I was throwing cautions to the winds, but I had to speak my\n\t\tmind, \"It actually is a lot of use to think over the past. It may help\n\t\tyou settle internal conflicts if done soundly.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"I have already thought through all the options at my disposal from\n\t\tevery angle possible\" he started, sitting in a comfortable position by\n\t\tthe wall. \"If my father was still alive, he would have told me to do\n\t\texactly what I am right now: to keep challenging myself, so one day I\n\t\tcan inherit his empire. If my mother and siblings were still with me,\n\t\tthey would have concluded to the same solution. The fact of the matter\n\t\tis: I am alone. I only have a decade or so to live. And I have much\n\t\tmore to learn, with no one to observe. The only other family we were\n\t\tclose to have been slaughtered, by the same people who have taken my\n\t\tfamily, I hope they haven't been treated the same way.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"My deepest apologies&#8230;\" I didn't know what else to say, so I\n\t\tasked the one question on my mind, \"Was it the same neighbors who\n\t\ttalked of large water planets?\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"The very same\" he whispered with a hollow laugh, \"At first we reasoned\n\t\tthey were psychotic. They always spoke about crazy things, for example,\n\t\twater worlds bigger than our own kingdom. With waves taller than the\n\t\ttrees. They even claimed to have gone across the large sand terrain;\n\t\twhich according to them, was blowing its wind across the large oceans.\n\t\tWe all believed they were out of their minds, until the day one of\n\t\ttheir tales turned out to be true.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"We had no time to react. They stormed in our house and dragged my mom\n\t\tholding her feet, both of my brothers sprung up, trying to free her. My\n\t\tbrothers were no match for Them, the only real threat was my mother.\n\t\tBut They were smart. They tied her first, so she can't hurt Them. Even\n\t\tmy sister tried to protect her. The only coward who stayed behind our\n\t\tbed, in the corner, was me. I was always taught to play it safe, being\n\t\ttold I was too young for anything. I had not even hunted a deer before\n\t\tthen, you can't imagine how my heart seemed to stand still at the sight\n\t\tof Them. My brother, S, was the first to become unconscious, he was the\n\t\tyoungest after me\" he said in barely audible, but steady voice, \"I\n\t\tcould hear my mother's anguished screams as they dragged them all down\n\t\tthis very room. I was half-torn by what was happening in front of my\n\t\teyes, and half-ashamed at myself for not being able to move. Such\n\t\thelplessness&#8230;I do not wish to my worst enemy.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Anyways, days after I mustered up the courage to face those ugly\n\t\tdemons, they were gone. Their camps deserted. I searched everywhere.\n\t\tRoaring for my family, but I couldn't find anything in their sheds.\n\t\tWell, except you\" he ended with a sigh, \"And even now, you are just as\n\t\tmuch of a mystery to me as you were from the day we first met.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- I wanted to ask him, how does he define ugliness? But there was more\n\t\timportant query to learn.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- I will tell you everything about me if you answer this: Why the\n\t\tworry, why the stress around aging? What exactly is it? And why does\n\t\tevery decision or action or determination you muster up relate it all\n\t\tback to that one characteristic? Moreover, some people dread it while\n\t\tothers look forward to it, but more fundamentally: Why do things age?\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"To tell you the truth, I don't really know. I am all ears, if you know\n\t\tthe answer but it is just useless to think about those things, because\n\t\tno one can do anything about it. It is just something that happens.\n\t\tEverything ages. And everything dies, that is the end of the line. I\n\t\thave till then, to rise to the throne\" even in the darkness, I saw his\n\t\tstare ablaze, \"I learned a lot of things on that tragic day, but one of\n\t\tthe biggest was: Life has the ability to bring true your worst\n\t\tfantasies, and it is up to us to be ready for them.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Why not just escape? As your neighbors suggested.\" I questioned,\n\t\trecalling part of our conversation from a week ago, which he ended on\n\t\tthis very question.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"They were just cowards! If they had just stayed with us, maybe we\n\t\tcould have put up a better fight. Instead, they tried to run away and\n\t\tgot caught&#8230;who knows, maybe they were the ones who sold us out\"\n\t\the growled, \"We should fear no one. It is not fit for us to be seen\n\t\trunning by others, that doesn't set a great example for a King now does\n\t\tit? Leave it&#8230;you wouldn't understand.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tHis tone was staunch, which marked the end of his voice in tonight's\n\t\tdiscussion. As I ruffled in the wind, I wish there was something I\n\t\tcould say to comfort him. But when I thought nothing would come to\n\t\tmind, an old memory resurfaced.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Stay still. Breathe lightly. Keep your palm open, wait for them to\n\t\ttickle it and close your fingers as fast as you can. It is about\n\t\tpatience, not energy.\" I finally suggested, \"now to answer your\n\t\tquestion about me, -\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Thank you!!

They weren't\n\t\tmuch taller than me, since I didn't need to strain myself to see their\n\t\theads even with my feet still buried inside. Besides having no clothes,\n\t\tthey hadn't bothered to add any accessories, and crawled sluggishly\n\t\tshowing fatigue.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Wow, are you marching towards something?\" I asked her softly, still\n\t\ttransfixed at the scene.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Yes, we're making our way back home.

How do you know\n\t\tthey will find the sea?\" I asked, \"They won't be able to even see the\n\t\twater from the mainland.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"The smell\" she said sensibly, \"They don't need to have their\n\t\tdestination in sight to take the first step.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"But what if they are attacked?

He kept disappearing every time he passed through\n\t\tthe shadows of the houses on the ghostly silent street. It was a quiet\n\t\tnight, with silence breaking only by the whiffle of the leaves.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"You're late today\" I pointed out, indicating the midnight chimes\n\t\temanating from the other side of the village, he approached me.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Eh, They came late today, dinner took longer than expected\" he\n\t\treplied, his eyes fixed towards the nearest house, with lights on and\n\t\tchimney still ensuing large puffs. He was sharper than me and had\n\t\tnoticed the figure making their way towards us sooner than I had. As\n\t\tusual, the moment he was in the view, whoever it was darted away at top\n\t\tspeed.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Why do you do this? Why do you make them run away like that?\" I asked,\n\t\twhile he sprung soundlessly from the wet grass and landed beside me\n\t\tlooking relaxed.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tHis mustache twitched a little, \"Freedom\" he said, \"I enjoy my freedom.\n\t\tThis way, they never get in my way.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- \"But at what cost? Is it, for example, worth making others fear\n\t\tyou?\" I asked.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"They fear me on their own accord!\" he protested, \"And I'm not the one\n\t\tsuffering, so I actually prefer this way.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- \"But can't you have your freedom while also dissolving fear between\n\t\tthe two?

This night turned out to be no different. \"I lost a\n\t\tfriend, more of an acquaintance really, earlier this week.

Time\n\t\twould always fly while I watched the occupants on the last row work on\n\t\ttheir laptops, barely listening to the lecture being staged in front of\n\t\tthem. I had lived on this tree for more than two years; its newest\n\t\tresident had joined me around four months ago. It took loud heaving\n\t\tsounds emitting from the branch below to break my attention.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Almost there!\" I encouraged him; he wasn't always like this. And from\n\t\tthe countless stories he had told me about his cousins, I suspected he\n\t\thad a problem.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Aren't you supposed to be an expert at this?\" I asked, watching him\n\t\tgasp for air.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Shut&#8230;it\" he said panting.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tAfter taking a moment to recover, he grabbed one of the container lids\n\t\tlaying neatly at the ridge and started biting on it.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Why do you eat that?\" I asked, almost repulsed, and offering him an\n\t\talmond instead.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"That is what They throw out\" he said shrugging, \"Sometimes the things\n\t\tare very tasty, you should try them.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tI stayed silent, watching him throw the lid on the ground and grabbing\n\t\ta wrapper. He had taken upon himself to secure all the garbage around\n\t\tour house. I had asked him why trash instead of the usual hazelnuts, he\n\t\tsaid They would always take the fallen leaves and nuts away, so he had\n\t\tto dig inside garbage cans to find things.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- \"It is odd isn't it, you litter nuts everywhere you go, and you said\n\t\tThey litter these plastic bits everywhere They go. What is the\n\t\tdifference between the two?\" I asked.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Well, I only care for myself. I store them in case I run out, only to\n\t\tlater forget where I kept them. They seem to care for everyone, the\n\t\tstuff They throw out is useful for me!\" he said, continuing to munch on\n\t\ta newly found plastic straw.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- Which is more important: intentions or results, of the action?\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tDue to his high regards for those around him, I didn't have the heart\n\t\tto tell him that his forgetfulness has caused the birth of more forests\n\t\tthan the junk surrounding us ever will.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tI absorbed myself again at the classroom underneath us, They were\n\t\talmost done if the time on the closest person's computer was correct.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Don't you envy Them?\" he asked, riveting his eyes on them, \"They have\n\t\tso much power. They know so much&#8230;you both are a lot alike you\n\t\tknow.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Is that so?\" I asked, with hint of a smile, \"Thank you for the\n\t\tcompliment but uhm - no, there isn't a competition of knowledge. So\n\t\tneed reason to get envious.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"&#8230;Hey, I need a favor. Can you put me down on that wooden\n\t\tsnow-covered bench?\" I asked slowly after a thought.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"What? No!

Before I could react in any way, I was covered in darkness\n\t\tas she stretched her massive russet pinions and landed itself on the\n\t\tlowest section of the nearest tree within two wing-beats. I continued\n\t\tto gaze silently as she combined my pieces with small twigs to build a\n\t\tmossy nest.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- Would she have torn me if she knew I could sense it? Which also\n\t\traised a supplementary question after some thought:\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- Is having a brain a blessing or a curse?\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tAfter a few days of repeated process, I was light enough for her to\n\t\tcarry in her curved culmen.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tIt turned out, she was not the only resident, her newborns were snugged\n\t\ttogether, examining the newest arrival from distance. It took them a\n\t\tfew hours to get comfortable around me, and before long they started to\n\t\tbelieve I was their lunch, which, thankfully I wasn't.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tSeveral days passed in silence, I was too tired to start another\n\t\tconversation and they were unaware of my awareness, which I preferred.\n\t\tThe eaglets were no more quiet fledglings, in fact the one with darkest\n\t\tplumage had started to fly. After every soar in the hazy skies, she\n\t\twould return excitedly and break in a babble with her siblings.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- If our perception of something changes from being pleasing to being\n\t\tannoying, are we attracted towards the entity or are we simply a fan of\n\t\tcertain qualities?\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tBut before I had more than a few seconds to think this one through, the\n\t\thazy skies turned ghastly dark with a cackle of thunder hidden amongst\n\t\tthem. As usually was the case in these scenarios, I was left behind as\n\t\tthey all left, the mother carrying the ones who still couldn't fly, to\n\t\ta higher branch.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tThe storm started around nightfall and ended long after dawn had\n\t\tarrived. The water level had risen high enough to soak me with splashed\n\t\traindrops. I wished they were safe. When the Sun broke out, I was\n\t\tcovered in leaves and what remained of a neatly woven roost.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tI saw them peer down at me, I counted all the heads, surveying from\n\t\tatop and debating among themselves if I should be used again, but it\n\t\tappeared that I was dismissed that day as they rose to gather sticks\n\t\tand stems from nearby bushes. What mesmerized me, was their eyes.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- Why did I see no remorse, no sadness or any sign of fatigue when\n\t\tthey saw their hard work demolished by no fault of their own?\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tIt took a whole week for them to conclude I was not soggy, and swoop me\n\t\tup to their nest, this time carried by a much softer beak.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- \"How great is it, to fly high within the clouds?

I\n\t\tquietly watched his shadow reappear from the Lahaina noon and progress\n\t\tslowly towards me while he continued digging the barren land. It wasn't\n\t\tuntil nightfall that he started to make his way back.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"You know, if not for that deer when we arrived, we would have been\n\t\thome quite some time ago\" he said, \"You got sidetrack for hours.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tHe sat down and laid me on his lap, removed the cloth, and started\n\t\teating hungrily without a single thought of cleaning his hands.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tAfter a few mouthfuls, he replied \"I wasn't sidetracked. The whole\n\t\tpurpose of all this is what we did earlier this morning.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"You're spending day after day just to help random herd of deer?\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Not just them. But everything else that lives\" he said, now opening\n\t\this bottle, I noticed he only took a miniature swig.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- \"Surely not everything?\" I asked, \"What about something dangerous?\n\t\tLike a tiger?\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Do you remember the day that we met?\" he asked slowly.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"You were planting bamboos, and I had washed ashore. What about it?\" I\n\t\tsaid, flummoxed at his mention of a memory more than a decade old.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"They were for the snakes. To avoid the heat-strokes\" he said.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- \"Why help those who hurt you?\" I asked bewildered. He was different\n\t\tfrom others, I thought to myself.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Same reason horses run when we whip them, it is in my nature\" he said,\n\t\ttaking another bite at stony piece of bread, \"They don't strike with\n\t\tintent of inflicting damage, but more in regards of not receiving it.\n\t\tIt is an act of self-defense. Sometimes hunger.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tI tried to connect the analogy of horse-racing with assisting animals,\n\t\tbut it was taking too long, so I stowed away the puzzle for later.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- \"Why so much care and regard for animals? They aren't anything like\n\t\tyou from what I've been told.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tHe replied looking morosely at me, \"I wish to meet some of the people\n\t\tyou have met.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tI let him enjoy his lunch (morphed into dinner), while he stared at the\n\t\tunfinished mounds of dirt.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"I was walking through the town once\" he stated randomly, \"and I came\n\t\tacross the strangest scene. A stray dog had a young macaque checking\n\t\thim for fleas. One night few months ago, I came across another peculiar\n\t\tstory. A dolphin, which was trained to retrieve litter in return for\n\t\tmeals, was breaking bits of paper into smaller pieces to receive more\n\t\tfish. I only founded out recently that the technology used in\n\t\tsubmarines to navigate is discovered from Bats.

What is the harm\n\t\tin getting rid of that serves no purpose?\" I repeated the rhetorical\n\t\tquestion I was asked ages ago.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Since when did something that serves no purpose to us translate to its\n\t\tworthiness of survival?\" he asked wryly, laughing while watching the\n\t\tdirt between his feet, forgetting his meal \"I believe we aren't here to\n\t\tmake a sculpture out of a tree. We are simply one branch out of\n\t\tthousands. And every time we cut one branch off, whether we visibly\n\t\tnotice it immediately or not, it affects us all.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- Why do some people talk in analogies? Although highly\n\t\tthought-provoking, is it hard to sometimes find the perfect metaphor? I\n\t\twonder.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"How do you know it affects you?\" I said.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Because it is in human nature to realize the importance of something\n\t\tonly after it has been lost. It was only after the oysters died out\n\t\tthat we noticed the waters getting dirtier, it took several experiments\n\t\tto study the significance of wolves in some foreign national park's\n\t\tecosystem.

How? You just ate! Uhh, are you alright?\" I asked uncertainly.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Better than ever.\" he said quietly with a minuscule grin, eyes still\n\t\tfixed vertically, \"Just a lot of thinking to do.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"I'm all ears.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"We aren't so logical\" he began abruptly, \"At least, not as much as I\n\t\tthought.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"And how do you come to that conclusion?\" I asked, wondering how much\n\t\tcan change in a mere few hours.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"All my life, I had thought we think with our brains, that we are the\n\t\tsmartest, and we use our smartness to make decisions.

If so, what is the\n\t\tharm if someone else does it?\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"I am sorry, but this doesn't help\" I sighed, a bit unnerved now, \"Can\n\t\tyou please start from the top?

They didn't come home until near morning, with a\n\t\tsomber news that delighted the whole town.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"All I had left was you and him&#8230;\" she cried, gazing out at the\n\t\twindy scene at a flock of lilac-rollers, which chirped its way back to\n\t\tits nest, \"And now I am sure I lost him as well.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- Why do you feel regret though? Could you have predicted their\n\t\tactions?\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"The reason for regret is that I know these people, I should have\n\t\tconsidered their reactions before telling them everything\" she answered\n\t\ttentatively.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- How much ignorance, do you think, is optional in this world and can\n\t\tbe eliminated simply by choice?\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- Well, what will you do now?\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"I&#8230;I don't know\" she said after a pause, \"One thing is for\n\t\tcertain, those lions, these birds, and us - all live for the same\n\t\tpurpose, to take care of each other. We all share sadness and laughter.\n\t\tWe all feel pain and joy. I need to know I didn't make a terrible\n\t\tmistake back there. I need to figure some things out.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"And uhh, how are you planning on doing that?\" I asked trying to keep\n\t\tup with her train of thought.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"By trying to learn, I am moving North. I heard people there are\n\t\tdeveloping some sort of new way of communication, a smarter way to\n\t\ttrack our thoughts and discussions using letters and scriptures; if\n\t\tthere is an answer, I will find it there\" she concluded resolutely,\n\t\tputting me aside, and striding out in the beautifully magenta evening\n\t\tperched upon tenuous clouds.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tAs she was stepping out, I shouted \"You really do seem determined to\n\t\tfollow your goal to &#173;&#173;&#822; &#822; !\"\n\t</p>\n</div>\n<br clear=\"all\"/>\n<div>\n\t<h2 align=\"center\">\n\t\tCHAPTER 7 -
