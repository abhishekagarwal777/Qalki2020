Can't we go later?\" I said while\n\t\tyawning, as we made our bumpy way down the leafy ridge. I could see the\n\t\tSun still climbing up the ebony trees from behind us. The light early\n\t\tmorning breeze was making us both shiver.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"The earlier we go, the safer we are. And you're not much help against\n\t\ta wild herd, are you?\" exclaimed K, \"anyways, I wanted to go alone. You\n\t\tinsisted! Do you want me to drop you off back home?\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tIt was my turn to protest this time, \"I've been waiting for weeks to\n\t\twitness you catch a fish, especially after your stories! I wouldn't\n\t\tmiss it for a thing.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tConsidering he had rest his case, he jogged on and we reached the\n\t\triverbed in silence. He called it a river, but it had a greater\n\t\tresemblance to a shallow stream to me. The water was as peaceful as the\n\t\tview of a patchy sky from inside a thicket of Matricarias. I watched\n\t\thim in silence pouncing upon the radiantly bronze Talapias and scaly\n\t\tgreenish Perches, but they appeared too swift for his immature\n\t\tattempts. After hours of fruitless effort, he made his way back to me.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tHe slouched down, panting he said, \"No luck today. I couldn't see a\n\t\tsingle fish. I suspect They are behind this.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"You describe them as having supernatural powers.\" I said sniggering,\n\t\t\"Besides I noticed plenty making their way&#8230;away from you.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tHe scowled and seemed on the verge of retorting but got tensed the\n\t\tmoment we heard movement on the opposite the bank. After a few seconds,\n\t\ta small calf emerged from the bushes and started drinking merely.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"I've got to try again.\" he said springing to his feet while his eyes\n\t\twere still on the animal on the other side.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Huh? What happened all of a sudden? You have all the time in the world\n\t\tto learn this, why can't we just get our lunch the usual way?\" I\n\t\tdemanded half-exasperatedly, making his way towards the water.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tAs he looked back at me, I could see the gold in his eyes, \"That is the\n\t\tthing&#8230;I don't have the time. I'm running out of it, and too fast\n\t\tactually.\" And with that, he was back in the water.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- What is Aging&#8230;he could never answer properly.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tIt was late in the evening that we began our way back home, which would\n\t\thave been empty handed and on an empty stomach if not for the young\n\t\ttannish hare on the way. We could see all sorts of life returning to\n\t\ttheir shelters with their loved ones. I saw him linger around a pair of\n\t\tgrey striped rock-buntings flutter around their nest, watching them\n\t\tlongingly.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"So why an unwavering need to learn fishing?\" I asked, breaking his\n\t\treverie. \"You have plenty of, more efficient might I add, ways of\n\t\tstaying well fed.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tWe started traveling again, and he took some time before answering. \"My\n\t\tkind is not fond of the water. We're not like that elephant you saw. I\n\t\ttold you, fishing was one thing my brothers couldn't do. Only my sister\n\t\tcould, but that wasn't a big deal since women are known to hunt anyways\n\t\tin our culture. As I grow up, I want to make sure that I can be a\n\t\tbetter King than they could have been.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tBy the time we reached home, the grounds were covered in starlight. We\n\t\talways had a hard time reaching the top of the hill, but K reasoned\n\t\tthat if it took him such difficulty, no one else would be able to make\n\t\tthe climb and it was apparent that my safety was his greatest priority,\n\t\talthough he was reluctant to admit it so blatantly.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Why is it so important for you to be the King? Can't you just live\n\t\tlife as it is right now?\" I questioned while he prepared to sleep,\n\t\tlaying me at my usual spot by the boulder covering majority of the\n\t\tentrance so I could view the sky outside through the crescent window.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"It is in my destiny. Or it was in my eldest brothers to be more\n\t\taccurate, but it is of no use reminiscing over the past now\" he added\n\t\tas an afterthought. \"But if they were here, I could spend a lot more\n\t\ttime showing you around. Maybe we could even have been able to explore\n\t\tthe other side of that river.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tI knew I was throwing cautions to the winds, but I had to speak my\n\t\tmind, \"It actually is a lot of use to think over the past. It may help\n\t\tyou settle internal conflicts if done soundly.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"I have already thought through all the options at my disposal from\n\t\tevery angle possible\" he started, sitting in a comfortable position by\n\t\tthe wall. \"If my father was still alive, he would have told me to do\n\t\texactly what I am right now: to keep challenging myself, so one day I\n\t\tcan inherit his empire. If my mother and siblings were still with me,\n\t\tthey would have concluded to the same solution. The fact of the matter\n\t\tis: I am alone. I only have a decade or so to live. And I have much\n\t\tmore to learn, with no one to observe. The only other family we were\n\t\tclose to have been slaughtered, by the same people who have taken my\n\t\tfamily, I hope they haven't been treated the same way.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"My deepest apologies&#8230;\" I didn't know what else to say, so I\n\t\tasked the one question on my mind, \"Was it the same neighbors who\n\t\ttalked of large water planets?\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"The very same\" he whispered with a hollow laugh, \"At first we reasoned\n\t\tthey were psychotic. They always spoke about crazy things, for example,\n\t\twater worlds bigger than our own kingdom. With waves taller than the\n\t\ttrees. They even claimed to have gone across the large sand terrain;\n\t\twhich according to them, was blowing its wind across the large oceans.\n\t\tWe all believed they were out of their minds, until the day one of\n\t\ttheir tales turned out to be true.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"We had no time to react. They stormed in our house and dragged my mom\n\t\tholding her feet, both of my brothers sprung up, trying to free her. My\n\t\tbrothers were no match for Them, the only real threat was my mother.\n\t\tBut They were smart. They tied her first, so she can't hurt Them. Even\n\t\tmy sister tried to protect her. The only coward who stayed behind our\n\t\tbed, in the corner, was me. I was always taught to play it safe, being\n\t\ttold I was too young for anything. I had not even hunted a deer before\n\t\tthen, you can't imagine how my heart seemed to stand still at the sight\n\t\tof Them. My brother, S, was the first to become unconscious, he was the\n\t\tyoungest after me\" he said in barely audible, but steady voice, \"I\n\t\tcould hear my mother's anguished screams as they dragged them all down\n\t\tthis very room. I was half-torn by what was happening in front of my\n\t\teyes, and half-ashamed at myself for not being able to move. Such\n\t\thelplessness&#8230;I do not wish to my worst enemy.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Anyways, days after I mustered up the courage to face those ugly\n\t\tdemons, they were gone. Their camps deserted. I searched everywhere.\n\t\tRoaring for my family, but I couldn't find anything in their sheds.\n\t\tWell, except you\" he ended with a sigh, \"And even now, you are just as\n\t\tmuch of a mystery to me as you were from the day we first met.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- I wanted to ask him, how does he define ugliness? But there was more\n\t\timportant query to learn.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- I will tell you everything about me if you answer this: Why the\n\t\tworry, why the stress around aging? What exactly is it? And why does\n\t\tevery decision or action or determination you muster up relate it all\n\t\tback to that one characteristic? Moreover, some people dread it while\n\t\tothers look forward to it, but more fundamentally: Why do things age?\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"To tell you the truth, I don't really know. I am all ears, if you know\n\t\tthe answer but it is just useless to think about those things, because\n\t\tno one can do anything about it. It is just something that happens.\n\t\tEverything ages. And everything dies, that is the end of the line. I\n\t\thave till then, to rise to the throne\" even in the darkness, I saw his\n\t\tstare ablaze, \"I learned a lot of things on that tragic day, but one of\n\t\tthe biggest was: Life has the ability to bring true your worst\n\t\tfantasies, and it is up to us to be ready for them.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Why not just escape? As your neighbors suggested.\" I questioned,\n\t\trecalling part of our conversation from a week ago, which he ended on\n\t\tthis very question.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"They were just cowards! If they had just stayed with us, maybe we\n\t\tcould have put up a better fight. Instead, they tried to run away and\n\t\tgot caught&#8230;who knows, maybe they were the ones who sold us out\"\n\t\the growled, \"We should fear no one. It is not fit for us to be seen\n\t\trunning by others, that doesn't set a great example for a King now does\n\t\tit? Leave it&#8230;you wouldn't understand.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tHis tone was staunch, which marked the end of his voice in tonight's\n\t\tdiscussion. As I ruffled in the wind, I wish there was something I\n\t\tcould say to comfort him. But when I thought nothing would come to\n\t\tmind, an old memory resurfaced.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Stay still. Breathe lightly. Keep your palm open, wait for them to\n\t\ttickle it and close your fingers as fast as you can.

Besides having no clothes,\n\t\tthey hadn't bothered to add any accessories, and crawled sluggishly\n\t\tshowing fatigue.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Wow, are you marching towards something?\" I asked her softly, still\n\t\ttransfixed at the scene.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Yes, we're making our way back home.

How do you know\n\t\tthey will find the sea?\" I asked, \"They won't be able to even see the\n\t\twater from the mainland.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"The smell\" she said sensibly, \"They don't need to have their\n\t\tdestination in sight to take the first step.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"But what if they are attacked?

He kept disappearing every time he passed through\n\t\tthe shadows of the houses on the ghostly silent street. It was a quiet\n\t\tnight, with silence breaking only by the whiffle of the leaves.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"You're late today\" I pointed out, indicating the midnight chimes\n\t\temanating from the other side of the village, he approached me.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Eh, They came late today, dinner took longer than expected\" he\n\t\treplied, his eyes fixed towards the nearest house, with lights on and\n\t\tchimney still ensuing large puffs. He was sharper than me and had\n\t\tnoticed the figure making their way towards us sooner than I had. As\n\t\tusual, the moment he was in the view, whoever it was darted away at top\n\t\tspeed.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Why do you do this? Why do you make them run away like that?\" I asked,\n\t\twhile he sprung soundlessly from the wet grass and landed beside me\n\t\tlooking relaxed.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tHis mustache twitched a little, \"Freedom\" he said, \"I enjoy my freedom.\n\t\tThis way, they never get in my way.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- \"But at what cost? Is it, for example, worth making others fear\n\t\tyou?\" I asked.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"They fear me on their own accord!\" he protested, \"And I'm not the one\n\t\tsuffering, so I actually prefer this way.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- \"But can't you have your freedom while also dissolving fear between\n\t\tthe two?

And when it is a choice between me and Them, I will\n\t\talways choose myself without hesitation. Besides, you really don't want\n\t\tto know what happens when They stop being afraid of you\" he said\n\t\tmysteriously. Besides being dramatic, he always had new stories and\n\t\tgossip to tell. This night turned out to be no different. \"I lost a\n\t\tfriend, more of an acquaintance really, earlier this week. I kept\n\t\ttelling him to keep his distance, but he ended up dying because he\n\t\tdidn't stand for his own freedom.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tDismissing his own warning, I did not have to ask him for elaboration;\n\t\tin fact, he became more enthused as his story progressed.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"There was an unnecessarily raucous festival a few days ago, apparently\n\t\this master went overboard and tried to force him to wear something that\n\t\twas suffocating, and he finally had enough.

Before I could react in any way, I was covered in darkness\n\t\tas she stretched her massive russet pinions and landed itself on the\n\t\tlowest section of the nearest tree within two wing-beats. I continued\n\t\tto gaze silently as she combined my pieces with small twigs to build a\n\t\tmossy nest.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- Would she have torn me if she knew I could sense it?

It took them a\n\t\tfew hours to get comfortable around me, and before long they started to\n\t\tbelieve I was their lunch, which, thankfully I wasn't.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tSeveral days passed in silence, I was too tired to start another\n\t\tconversation and they were unaware of my awareness, which I preferred.\n\t\tThe eaglets were no more quiet fledglings, in fact the one with darkest\n\t\tplumage had started to fly. After every soar in the hazy skies, she\n\t\twould return excitedly and break in a babble with her siblings.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- If our perception of something changes from being pleasing to being\n\t\tannoying, are we attracted towards the entity or are we simply a fan of\n\t\tcertain qualities?\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tBut before I had more than a few seconds to think this one through, the\n\t\thazy skies turned ghastly dark with a cackle of thunder hidden amongst\n\t\tthem.

I\n\t\tquietly watched his shadow reappear from the Lahaina noon and progress\n\t\tslowly towards me while he continued digging the barren land. It wasn't\n\t\tuntil nightfall that he started to make his way back.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"You know, if not for that deer when we arrived, we would have been\n\t\thome quite some time ago\" he said, \"You got sidetrack for hours.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tHe sat down and laid me on his lap, removed the cloth, and started\n\t\teating hungrily without a single thought of cleaning his hands.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tAfter a few mouthfuls, he replied \"I wasn't sidetracked. The whole\n\t\tpurpose of all this is what we did earlier this morning.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"You're spending day after day just to help random herd of deer?\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Not just them.

To avoid the heat-strokes\" he said.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- \"Why help those who hurt you?\" I asked bewildered. He was different\n\t\tfrom others, I thought to myself.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Same reason horses run when we whip them, it is in my nature\" he said,\n\t\ttaking another bite at stony piece of bread, \"They don't strike with\n\t\tintent of inflicting damage, but more in regards of not receiving it.\n\t\tIt is an act of self-defense. Sometimes hunger.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tI tried to connect the analogy of horse-racing with assisting animals,\n\t\tbut it was taking too long, so I stowed away the puzzle for later.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- \"Why so much care and regard for animals? They aren't anything like\n\t\tyou from what I've been told.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tHe replied looking morosely at me, \"I wish to meet some of the people\n\t\tyou have met.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tI let him enjoy his lunch (morphed into dinner), while he stared at the\n\t\tunfinished mounds of dirt.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"I was walking through the town once\" he stated randomly, \"and I came\n\t\tacross the strangest scene. A stray dog had a young macaque checking\n\t\thim for fleas. One night few months ago, I came across another peculiar\n\t\tstory. A dolphin, which was trained to retrieve litter in return for\n\t\tmeals, was breaking bits of paper into smaller pieces to receive more\n\t\tfish. I only founded out recently that the technology used in\n\t\tsubmarines to navigate is discovered from Bats.

What is the harm\n\t\tin getting rid of that serves no purpose?\" I repeated the rhetorical\n\t\tquestion I was asked ages ago.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Since when did something that serves no purpose to us translate to its\n\t\tworthiness of survival?\" he asked wryly, laughing while watching the\n\t\tdirt between his feet, forgetting his meal \"I believe we aren't here to\n\t\tmake a sculpture out of a tree.

Although highly\n\t\tthought-provoking, is it hard to sometimes find the perfect metaphor? I\n\t\twonder.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"How do you know it affects you?\" I said.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Because it is in human nature to realize the importance of something\n\t\tonly after it has been lost.

I had to choose a career that was rewarding.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- \"What is 'rewarding' for you?\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"A degree that pays well! Field that is in demand\" she said with an\n\t\texpression of someone adding two and two.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- \"How does 'wanting to prove' oneself translate to getting a job with\n\t\tbig salary?\" I didn't know, but it was clear that she would have gotten\n\t\tannoyed if I had asked.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tInstead, I decided to press on something else.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- \"So college is the place to gain information to get better jobs?\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"This is the place to gain any kind of information you want, not just\n\t\tto get better jobs. They teach everything. From peace to war, our\n\t\tsuccesses and failures. Some of the things are biased, some aren't.\"\n\t\tshe said indifferently, taking another sip, \"If you are interested in\n\t\tknowledge, the library has more books than you can read in a lifetime.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tAt this, I was taken back to the cold night few months ago, watching a\n\t\tclassroom session from bird's-eye. Now I wished I could change my\n\t\tanswer.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- \"What do students do with the information?\" I asked, recalling the\n\t\tconversation.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Well, they have the <em>potential </em>to tackle world-wide problems\"\n\t\tshe said with an emphasis, \"but truth be told, everyone's just absorbed\n\t\tin their own lives. Some do go on to do big things, but most only use\n\t\tpart of what they've learned, mainly the part that is required in their\n\t\tjobs. Rest is deemed 'useless' and forgotten as time moves on\" she\n\t\tfinished sardonically.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"What?\" she asked at my bemused expression.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- \"What guilty conscience, or expectations, made you phrase your\n\t\tanswer in such a way? All I wanted to know was if their experience here\n\t\twas worth it, and how efficient was the learning process\" I explained\n\t\tcalmly.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"It's fine&#8230;just leave it. The issues we face today are too big to\n\t\ttackle by people like us anyways\" she said, almost to herself as she\n\t\tstared in the depths of her cup, \"Best to just handle our life.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"That reminds me of a conversation I had with a friend long time ago, I\n\t\ttold her almost the exact same thing\" I said, \"when she kept rambling\n\t\ton.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"What did she say?\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"'The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they\n\t\tdon't have any'\" I said shortly.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tWe both sat in silence, me looking up at the marvelous sky-scrapers\n\t\tabove the shimmering city lights, while she leaned back with closed\n\t\teyes.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"What can I do?\" she asked, looking at me seriously and taking the last\n\t\tgulp from the now cold drink.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Start with something small. And learn from it. Find a way, or create\n\t\tone, for people to separate trash by edible, non-edible and any other\n\t\tmeans you see fit, it will help with re-using and decomposing it\" I\n\t\tsaid, thinking about my branch partner, \"And if you can think of any\n\t\tway to help the birds and squirrels living on campus, that would be\n\t\tgreat too.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Why?\" she asked startled, \"What's wrong with them?\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"I guess it is time you meet the reason why you've to put me securely\n\t\tby that bench every night before you go home\" I said genially,\n\t\t\"Remember to be gentle, and oh, he loves to get patted.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Wha- I'm lost, it's okay let's just go! It's about time I got some\n\t\tanswers\" she said excitedly, whipping her lips on the cuffs of her\n\t\tsleeve, as she threw the cup and the unused napkins in a plastic bin\n\t\tlabeled 'Recycle', \"one more thing, it was you who side-tracked this\n\t\ttime.

And more importantly, Why?\" I\n\t\twanted to ask, but it would have jeopardized my involvement in the\n\t\ttrip.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tIt took a lot of egging on from me and his family to have him step\n\t\toutside the house that Friday evening. I thought his temperament would\n\t\timprove in the journey, but the car ride mainly consisted eye-rolls at\n\t\tevery syllable uttered from the front seats, so I figured it would be\n\t\tbest if I stayed silent.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"What is this place?!\" he asked in an outrage, the moment everyone\n\t\tstepped out of the car, \"You didn't tell me we were going to a shack!\n\t\tHow will I look sitting in here?! Ugh, I'm not eating here.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tFrom what he later described, the place was no bigger than an elongated\n\t\tjoint.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tAs we made our way inside, I expected majority of the dinner to be\n\t\teaten in silence that day with his parents giving up after numerous\n\t\tineffectual efforts to exchange pleasantries. Wanting to avoid the\n\t\tawkwardness, I busied myself with pondering on (rather boringly) the\n\t\ttopic of food preferences.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- Why is everyone so unique? Ranging from different textures to food\n\t\tpalates, is there any one flavor that is superior to others? And what\n\t\tdecides the favorite type of cuisine that we grow with? Most important\n\t\tof all, why do these favorites change?\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tBuried in my thoughts, I failed to grasp the change in atmosphere as we\n\t\tstepped out with full stomachs and rather loud chatter. I did notice\n\t\tthe animation in his voice as we drove back home but decided not to\n\t\tintrude upon their family time.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Sooo I'm guessing the food wasn't so bad after all?\" I asked after\n\t\tseveral minutes of complete silence once we were back in his room; me\n\t\tslanted besides a lava lamp set on the nightstand while he sat with his\n\t\tarms crossed under his head, staring at the muted ceiling on his bed.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tHe chuckled after a delay, \"Haha&#8230;I completely forgot how the food\n\t\twas.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Huh? How? You just ate! Uhh, are you alright?\" I asked uncertainly.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Better than ever.\" he said quietly with a minuscule grin, eyes still\n\t\tfixed vertically, \"Just a lot of thinking to do.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"I'm all ears.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"We aren't so logical\" he began abruptly, \"At least, not as much as I\n\t\tthought.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"And how do you come to that conclusion?\" I asked, wondering how much\n\t\tcan change in a mere few hours.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"All my life, I had thought we think with our brains, that we are the\n\t\tsmartest, and we use our smartness to make decisions. But today I was\n\t\tproven wrong\" he said with a chuckle; for a person who was just proven\n\t\twrong, he seemed to be in a great mood.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- Do people like when they prove themselves wrong? If so, what is the\n\t\tharm if someone else does it?\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"I am sorry, but this doesn't help\" I sighed, a bit unnerved now, \"Can\n\t\tyou please start from the top? Truth be told, right after we entered\n\t\tthe trattoria.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tHe started, \"We went in, and I was still in a bad mood, which, now that\n\t\tI think about it, was stupid\" he added uneasily, \"and we sat at the\n\t\tfarthest corner because I didn't want to risk being seen by my\n\t\tcolleagues in such a place. We were all silent and it was actually my\n\t\tsister who broke the tension.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"What did she say?\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"&#8230;She cried. They gave her a menu which she could use\" his said\n\t\tthroatily, \"&#8230;it had braille.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tWe didn't continue for the next few minutes, it was at moments like\n\t\tthese, when I wish more than ever that I could be one of you.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"How does that equate with humans not being logical?\" I asked, breaking\n\t\tthe trance.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Well how many people do you think visit that restaurant a day? And\n\t\twhat percentage of them require such an addition to the menu?\" he\n\t\tasked.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"I'd say, not many in this period.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Exactly!\" he said excitedly, turning towards me, \"And how much do you\n\t\tthink it costed them to make those menus? Mind you, they don't even\n\t\tneed a menu with the amount of variety they have!\" he said laughing,\n\t\t\"Yet, they still went one step ahead than all the other places&#8230;so\n\t\twe met the owner.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"He said he didn't care about the money, he just wanted everyone to\n\t\thave a good time. We asked if he knew anyone - you know, and he said\n\t\tno. Usually people like these have had personal experience. It's just\n\t\tso odd&#8230;I've never seen an act of kindness like this. Up until\n\t\tnow, I figured everyone everywhere was materialistic.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- Dang, Isn't that a huge generalization? I wonder what something made\n\t\tyou theorize that?\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"I mean I know better now!\" he said scrupulously, \"But all - no wait,\n\t\tmost - !\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Most?\" I asked skeptically.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Okay okay!\" The people <em>I</em> have met\" he continued with an\n\t\temphasis, \"usually care only for the money. And themselves.\" he added\n\t\tas an after-thought.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- Why is that you think?\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"I don't know but I am not about to make the same mistake again and\n\t\tgroup everyone in the same boat!\" he said slyly, \"I will tell you some\n\t\texperiences later; the important thing after tonight is: my faith in\n\t\thumanity is restored\" he finished with a content smile.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- I wanted to ask, \"What event forsook it?\" but felt it would dampen\n\t\this energy. Instead, I asked: So, what now?\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"I'm going back to that place. This time with friends\" he said, now\n\t\tpositively sitting on his bed, with the phone receiver already in his\n\t\thands, \"I want to help the family running it. It's people like him, who\n\t\tare trying to change the world, who need our help.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- I wonder if he really does think that way? That his actions are\n\t\t'changing the world'? Besides, for every hundred places, you may find\n\t\tone similar to your recent visit, is the world really changing?\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Yeah&#8230;you know what, every journey begins with one step. He is\n\t\tsimply doing what he feels is right, he isn't thinking about changing\n\t\tthe whole world. I've lost too much time being negative, I don't want\n\t\tto take that mentality to my grave, it is about time I started to hope\n\t\tagain. I will never forget that radiant expression on my sister's\n\t\tface&#8230;it was a perfect present for my Dad getting hired\" he said,\n\t\twiping on his sleeves.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- I couldn't think of anything to reply, until one thought crossed my\n\t\tmind: It is odd isn't it? That you found such joy and happiness in\n\t\tsomething illogical and emotion driven, while using your 'intellect'\n\t\tonly got you away from those close to you?\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"I learned something else important today\" he ended laughingly, \"don't\n\t\tjudge a book by its cover\" he said with a wink, as he started to dial.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<a name=\"_Hlk526373544\">\n\t\t\tEveryone likes to change the world, but no one wants to change\n\t\t\tthemselves. -Well, clearly not 'no one'.\n\t\t</a>\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tI try to keep my requests to a minimum, but I must plead: if it is\n\t\tpossible for you, it would mean the most to be transcribed in braille.\n\t</p>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<table\n\t\t\tcellspacing=\"0\"\n\t\t\tcellpadding=\"0\"\n\t\t\thspace=\"0\"\n\t\t\tvspace=\"0\"\n\t\t\talign=\"left\"\n\t\t>\n\t\t\t<tbody>\n\t\t\t\t<tr>\n\t\t\t\t\t<td valign=\"top\" align=\"left\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"I\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t</td>\n\t\t\t\t</tr>\n\t\t\t</tbody>\n\t\t</table>\n\t</div>\n\t<p>\n\t\twish I was not born in this era\" she sighed.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- Why?

The Sahelian winds are\n\t\tmaking it harder and harder to stay outside, not to mention grown-ups\n\t\targuing like kids! I thought it would all end after we broke off but\n\t\tguess not.

Way too quickly. While\n\t\teveryone takes the more logical route, I get too involved into my\n\t\temotions and end up creating more trouble than necessary.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- How much trouble really is necessary to live? I also wonder what it\n\t\tmeans to get <em>too </em>into emotions.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Other humans don't get attached?\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"They do! But to things that matter. Ever since I was little, I used to\n\t\tcare too much for the silliest things\" she said disappointedly, \"You\n\t\tsaw, didn't you? How I spent hours trying to catch that one golden\n\t\tlittle cute fish and let it go instead of taking it?\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Well I think the conundrum arises in how you describe them\" I nudged\n\t\twith a small smile, \"Why do you think it is cute to begin with?\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Ugh, I don't know&#8230;don't ask me such questions!\" she retorted\n\t\tcrossly, then quickly pouring out her annoyance \"but if I hadn't spent\n\t\thours on that cavity filled baobab tree with Shiro, we wouldn't have\n\t\tmet. You do realize, that right?\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Where's Shiro now? I haven't seen her in a while!\" I implored,\n\t\t\"Besides, I thought that was your home?\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"I already told you, everything is drying up. We had to move West.\n\t\tThere was nothing but obstacles for us over there\" she had reduced back\n\t\tinto the hollow tone, \"What was worse is the endless quarrels between\n\t\tthe Heads, half wanted to move South, including Shiro and her family,\n\t\tand another half towards other civilizations due to rumors about some\n\t\tnew inventions. Well, I hope they had better luck than us. Since over\n\t\there, we've had nothing but more trouble.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Is the water supply not adequate? Or is there a problem with creating\n\t\tproper tools?\" I asked, \"I thought you already took care of the food\n\t\tscarcity.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Yes yes, and I thank you for helping me out with that\" she replied\n\t\tdismissively, waving her hand \"but the new problem was the pack of\n\t\tlions.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"But didn't you mention that one of them was your friend?

You don't see\n\t\tmost like them around here though, most are rest orangish with a bronze\n\t\ttint\" she said with perking up at once, then giggling a little \"He was\n\t\tso timid too! Kind of reminds me of myself when I was little&#8230;but\n\t\tit all turned sideways the moment I mentioned it to my mother last\n\t\tnight\" she ended ruefully.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"Well that was for your safety, they may be dangerous.\" I explained.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"&#8230;I think I made a huge mistake though.\" she said defeated, upon\n\t\tmy questioned look, she went on, \"Because they weren't really hurting\n\t\tus, were they?

Him and others\n\t\twent in the middle of the night, first to that waterway, then around\n\t\tthe neighboring hills. They didn't come home until near morning, with a\n\t\tsomber news that delighted the whole town.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"All I had left was you and him&#8230;\" she cried, gazing out at the\n\t\twindy scene at a flock of lilac-rollers, which chirped its way back to\n\t\tits nest, \"And now I am sure I lost him as well.\"\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- Why do you feel regret though? Could you have predicted their\n\t\tactions?\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"The reason for regret is that I know these people, I should have\n\t\tconsidered their reactions before telling them everything\" she answered\n\t\ttentatively.\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- How much ignorance, do you think, is optional in this world and can\n\t\tbe eliminated simply by choice?\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\tQ- Well, what will you do now?\n\t</p>\n\t<p>\n\t\t\"I&#8230;I don't know\" she said after a pause, \"One thing is for\n\t\tcertain, those lions, these birds, and us - all live for the same\n\t\tpurpose, to take care of each other. We all share sadness and laughter.\n\t\tWe all feel pain and joy. I need to know I didn't make a terrible\n\t\tmistake back there.
