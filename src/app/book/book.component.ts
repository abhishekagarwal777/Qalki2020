		A: I'm not sure about this. I'm not a writer.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q: Huh? Where is this coming from?
	</p>
	<p>
		A: I - I can't "encapsulate" people's attention for hours and transform
		the world around them; I don't have the skill!
	</p>
	<p>
		Q: Ah, <em>that.</em> If I recall correctly, it was your suggestion
		that we change my route. So why the second thoughts change now?
	</p>
	<p>
		A: Ya, I know! I know! I'm just worried, what if I fail?
	</p>
	<p>
		Q: Then you lose the time you spent on it. Never to get it back. But
		the more important question is: Would there be regret later on that you
		did not try?
	</p>
	<p>
		A: &#8230;Sorry. You're right.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q: That reminds me of something one of your own once told me "It is
		completely up to us to pass verdict on our outcome".
	</p>
	<p>
		A: Hmm, and yours?
	</p>
	<p>
		Q: And since when has my goal been the same as yours?
	</p>
	<p>
		A: Any last-minute advice before I start?
	</p>
	<p>
		Q: Simply one - Remember why we're doing this.
	</p>
	<p>
		A: Thanks&#8230;last question: Do I include this conversation?
	</p>
	<p>
		Q: Of course. Why would this be treated any differently?
	</p>
	<p>
		A: Alright, I had to ask since I really don't know how you think
		sometimes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q: At times like these, I wish I could roll eyes. Let's divert the
		topic, I've been curious: what does tea taste like?
	</p>
	<p>
		A: There you go again&#8230;

		we really have to get up this early? Can't we go later?" I said while
		yawning, as we made our bumpy way down the leafy ridge. I could see the
		Sun still climbing up the ebony trees from behind us. The light early
		morning breeze was making us both shiver.
	</p>
	<p>
		"The earlier we go, the safer we are. And you're not much help against
		a wild herd, are you?" exclaimed K, "anyways, I wanted to go alone. You
		insisted! Do you want me to drop you off back home?"
	</p>
	<p>
		It was my turn to protest this time, "I've been waiting for weeks to
		witness you catch a fish, especially after your stories! I wouldn't
		miss it for a thing."
	</p>
	<p>
		Considering he had rest his case, he jogged on and we reached the
		riverbed in silence. He called it a river, but it had a greater
		resemblance to a shallow stream to me. The water was as peaceful as the
		view of a patchy sky from inside a thicket of Matricarias. I watched
		him in silence pouncing upon the radiantly bronze Talapias and scaly
		greenish Perches, but they appeared too swift for his immature
		attempts. After hours of fruitless effort, he made his way back to me.
	</p>
	<p>
		He slouched down, panting he said, "No luck today. I couldn't see a
		single fish. I suspect They are behind this."
	</p>
	<p>
		"You describe them as having supernatural powers." I said sniggering,
		"Besides I noticed plenty making their way&#8230;away from you."
	</p>
	<p>
		He scowled and seemed on the verge of retorting but got tensed the
		moment we heard movement on the opposite the bank. After a few seconds,
		a small calf emerged from the bushes and started drinking merely.
	</p>
	<p>
		"I've got to try again." he said springing to his feet while his eyes
		were still on the animal on the other side.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Huh? What happened all of a sudden? You have all the time in the world
		to learn this, why can't we just get our lunch the usual way?" I
		demanded half-exasperatedly, making his way towards the water.
	</p>
	<p>
		As he looked back at me, I could see the gold in his eyes, "That is the
		thing&#8230;I don't have the time. I'm running out of it, and too fast
		actually." And with that, he was back in the water.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- What is Aging&#8230;he could never answer properly.
	</p>
	<p>
		It was late in the evening that we began our way back home, which would
		have been empty handed and on an empty stomach if not for the young
		tannish hare on the way. We could see all sorts of life returning to
		their shelters with their loved ones. I saw him linger around a pair of
		grey striped rock-buntings flutter around their nest, watching them
		longingly.
	</p>
	<p>
		"So why an unwavering need to learn fishing?" I asked, breaking his
		reverie. "You have plenty of, more efficient might I add, ways of
		staying well fed."
	</p>
	<p>
		We started traveling again, and he took some time before answering. "My
		kind is not fond of the water. We're not like that elephant you saw. I
		told you, fishing was one thing my brothers couldn't do. Only my sister
		could, but that wasn't a big deal since women are known to hunt anyways
		in our culture. As I grow up, I want to make sure that I can be a
		better King than they could have been."
	</p>
	<p>
		By the time we reached home, the grounds were covered in starlight. We
		always had a hard time reaching the top of the hill, but K reasoned
		that if it took him such difficulty, no one else would be able to make
		the climb and it was apparent that my safety was his greatest priority,
		although he was reluctant to admit it so blatantly.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Why is it so important for you to be the King? Can't you just live
		life as it is right now?" I questioned while he prepared to sleep,
		laying me at my usual spot by the boulder covering majority of the
		entrance so I could view the sky outside through the crescent window.
	</p>
	<p>
		"It is in my destiny. Or it was in my eldest brothers to be more
		accurate, but it is of no use reminiscing over the past now" he added
		as an afterthought. "But if they were here, I could spend a lot more
		time showing you around. Maybe we could even have been able to explore
		the other side of that river."
	</p>
	<p>
		I knew I was throwing cautions to the winds, but I had to speak my
		mind, "It actually is a lot of use to think over the past. It may help
		you settle internal conflicts if done soundly."
	</p>
	<p>
		"I have already thought through all the options at my disposal from
		every angle possible" he started, sitting in a comfortable position by
		the wall. "If my father was still alive, he would have told me to do
		exactly what I am right now: to keep challenging myself, so one day I
		can inherit his empire. If my mother and siblings were still with me,
		they would have concluded to the same solution. The fact of the matter
		is: I am alone. I only have a decade or so to live. And I have much
		more to learn, with no one to observe. The only other family we were
		close to have been slaughtered, by the same people who have taken my
		family, I hope they haven't been treated the same way."
	</p>
	<p>
		"My deepest apologies&#8230;" I didn't know what else to say, so I
		asked the one question on my mind, "Was it the same neighbors who
		talked of large water planets?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"The very same" he whispered with a hollow laugh, "At first we reasoned
		they were psychotic. They always spoke about crazy things, for example,
		water worlds bigger than our own kingdom. With waves taller than the
		trees. They even claimed to have gone across the large sand terrain;
		which according to them, was blowing its wind across the large oceans.
		We all believed they were out of their minds, until the day one of
		their tales turned out to be true.
	</p>
	<p>
		"We had no time to react. They stormed in our house and dragged my mom
		holding her feet, both of my brothers sprung up, trying to free her. My
		brothers were no match for Them, the only real threat was my mother.
		But They were smart. They tied her first, so she can't hurt Them. Even
		my sister tried to protect her. The only coward who stayed behind our
		bed, in the corner, was me. I was always taught to play it safe, being
		told I was too young for anything. I had not even hunted a deer before
		then, you can't imagine how my heart seemed to stand still at the sight
		of Them. My brother, S, was the first to become unconscious, he was the
		youngest after me" he said in barely audible, but steady voice, "I
		could hear my mother's anguished screams as they dragged them all down
		this very room. I was half-torn by what was happening in front of my
		eyes, and half-ashamed at myself for not being able to move. Such
		helplessness&#8230;I do not wish to my worst enemy."
	</p>
	<p>
		"Anyways, days after I mustered up the courage to face those ugly
		demons, they were gone. Their camps deserted. I searched everywhere.
		Roaring for my family, but I couldn't find anything in their sheds.
		Well, except you" he ended with a sigh, "And even now, you are just as
		much of a mystery to me as you were from the day we first met."
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- I wanted to ask him, how does he define ugliness? But there was more
		important query to learn.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- I will tell you everything about me if you answer this: Why the
		worry, why the stress around aging? What exactly is it? And why does
		every decision or action or determination you muster up relate it all
		back to that one characteristic? Moreover, some people dread it while
		others look forward to it, but more fundamentally: Why do things age?
	</p>
	<p>
		"To tell you the truth, I don't really know. I am all ears, if you know
		the answer but it is just useless to think about those things, because
		no one can do anything about it. It is just something that happens.
		Everything ages. And everything dies, that is the end of the line. I
		have till then, to rise to the throne" even in the darkness, I saw his
		stare ablaze, "I learned a lot of things on that tragic day, but one of
		the biggest was: Life has the ability to bring true your worst
		fantasies, and it is up to us to be ready for them."
	</p>
	<p>
		"Why not just escape? As your neighbors suggested." I questioned,
		recalling part of our conversation from a week ago, which he ended on
		this very question.
	</p>
	<p>
		"They were just cowards! If they had just stayed with us, maybe we
		could have put up a better fight. Instead, they tried to run away and
		got caught&#8230;who knows, maybe they were the ones who sold us out"
		he growled, "We should fear no one. It is not fit for us to be seen
		running by others, that doesn't set a great example for a King now does
		it? Leave it&#8230;you wouldn't understand."
	</p>
	<p>
		His tone was staunch, which marked the end of his voice in tonight's
		discussion. As I ruffled in the wind, I wish there was something I
		could say to comfort him. But when I thought nothing would come to
		mind, an old memory resurfaced.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Stay still. Breathe lightly. Keep your palm open, wait for them to
		tickle it and close your fingers as fast as you can. It is about
		patience, not energy." I finally suggested, "now to answer your
		question about me, -"
	</p>
	<p>
		"Thank you!! Thank you so much!" he roared with a grin and jumping on
		his feet at once, "let's go! Let's go now!"
	</p>
	<p>
		"What?! Calm down Kimba." I murmured stifling a yawn, "You need rest.
		And truthfully speaking, as do I."
	</p>
	<p>
		"Haha, it feels odd for you to call me using my full name&#8230;reminds
		me of father, he was the one who gave me my name", he had moved closer
		to the edge, resting his paw on my side and settling down "&#8230;the
		last words from my mother, and the first words from you were the exact
		same: Make History."
	</p>
	<p>
		Not knowing something shouldn't be insulting; the real tragedy is not
		having the willingness to learn something new.

		took me a moment to realize where I ended up, staring at the hazy sky
		at an angle above while being half buried in the sand, but I was
		finally ashore. The crystalline water filled the salty air with mist as
		I heard the waves crash over each other in front of me; thankfully, it
		appeared that I arrived during high-tide.
	</p>
	<p>
		At first glance around, I thought I was alone; until I heard a soft,
		steady sound of sand being pressured as someone slowly approached me.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Ouch!" she said worriedly, "I'm so sorry! I didn't mean to step on
		you, I didn't see you."
	</p>
	<p>
		"It's quite alright" I muttered, brushing broken shells off. I looked
		behind me to see the new company and couldn't believe the approaching
		sight.
	</p>
	<p>
		Around a thousand females, barbaric and tiny were the first words that
		came to my mind, were making their way towards the sea. They weren't
		much taller than me, since I didn't need to strain myself to see their
		heads even with my feet still buried inside. Besides having no clothes,
		they hadn't bothered to add any accessories, and crawled sluggishly
		showing fatigue.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Wow, are you marching towards something?" I asked her softly, still
		transfixed at the scene.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Yes, we're making our way back home. We live on the other side of this
		continent. We cross the ocean every fifteen Summers to return to our
		birthplace, for the preservation of -"
	</p>
	<p>
		But what she wanted to preserve, I had no idea as I watched her get
		raised unceremoniously by a giant arm and get tossed in the water. I
		gaped at the intruder, who ran on all fours with huge leaps after her,
		horrorstruck.
	</p>
	<p>
		"- our heritage" said a wise voice right beside me, "We had come to
		give birth to our young ones, but now it is our time to go back."
	</p>
	<p>
		From what I could tell, this crowd was pitifully defenseless against
		another attack like the one I just witnessed.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- "To what ends will parents go for their kids?" I wanted to ask her,
		but something else occurred to me as I watched her steadily progress
		towards the shoreline.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- "Aren't you worried your newborns will rove around? How do you know
		they will find the sea?" I asked, "They won't be able to even see the
		water from the mainland."
	</p>
	<p>
		"The smell" she said sensibly, "They don't need to have their
		destination in sight to take the first step."
	</p>
	<p>
		"But what if they are attacked? What if they suffer the same
		consequences as your friend just now?" I asked worriedly, it was odd to
		cross thousands of miles only to leave their offspring's so soon.
	</p>
	<p>
		"We are as helpless as they are when it comes to Them. But fortunately,
		that enormous baby who grabbed my friend just now was trying to help
		her" she replied with a smile.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Some are cruel&#8230;yes" she added, "I lost plenty of my kin few
		decades ago due to Them, but I have seen tremendous care and kindness
		from Them. I cannot judge the whole race by an act of a few, right?"
	</p>
	<p>
		She suddenly didn't seem so primitive anymore, "How much do you know
		about Them?" I asked, wondering just how knowledgeable she might be.
	</p>
	<p>
		"There was a kind before Them. My grandmother used to tell me stories.
		It looked just like the one you saw, but bigger skulls. Smarter. But
		they ended up perishing" she concluded dully.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Why? What did they do wrong?" I asked.
	</p>
	<p>
		"It is what they didn't do: they didn't migrate. They did; that is why
		They survived. Just like we are right now" she appeared tired, and
		throughout whole conversation, I realized she had not stopped for a
		second, "We are a lot alike, I am not sure if they realize. There are
		also differences. But They take leaps of faiths as well."
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- "Aren't you afraid of Them? Don't you think They are superior?" I
		asked tentatively, not wanting to push her. However, she laughed, and
		life finally appeared inside her saggy eyes.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Differences do not equate to superiority. They are great at certain
		things. We are great at others. For instance, They cannot navigate the
		same way we do. Salmons memorize the chemicals. we trust the Waves
		emitting from the Earth to lead us. They depend on their devices.
		Everyone is unique" she explained calmly.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- "What do I call you?" I asked, almost having to shout with the
		distance increasing between us and wanting to make sure I remember this
		encounter.
	</p>
	<p>
		"You can call me Ridley. I am sorry, but I really must go now!" she
		answered looking back after momentous thinking while her eyes scanned
		the spot her friend had landed.
	</p>
	<p>
		In that moment, I realized that there was softness underneath the hard
		shell.
	</p>
	<p>
		In return for her favor of the days of silence in pondering that
		followed, I mischievously shouted after her, "I hope you do beat that
		Hare someday!"
	</p>
	<p>
		Sometimes life only gives us hints or a creak in the door; and we've to
		push it open completely.

		had one of the most lustrous jet-black coat that I had ever seen; the
		reddish yellow street lights were bouncing from its fur, making his
		eyes ghostly radiant. He kept disappearing every time he passed through
		the shadows of the houses on the ghostly silent street. It was a quiet
		night, with silence breaking only by the whiffle of the leaves.
	</p>
	<p>
		"You're late today" I pointed out, indicating the midnight chimes
		emanating from the other side of the village, he approached me.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Eh, They came late today, dinner took longer than expected" he
		replied, his eyes fixed towards the nearest house, with lights on and
		chimney still ensuing large puffs. He was sharper than me and had
		noticed the figure making their way towards us sooner than I had. As
		usual, the moment he was in the view, whoever it was darted away at top
		speed.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Why do you do this? Why do you make them run away like that?" I asked,
		while he sprung soundlessly from the wet grass and landed beside me
		looking relaxed.
	</p>
	<p>
		His mustache twitched a little, "Freedom" he said, "I enjoy my freedom.
		This way, they never get in my way."
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- "But at what cost? Is it, for example, worth making others fear
		you?" I asked.
	</p>
	<p>
		"They fear me on their own accord!" he protested, "And I'm not the one
		suffering, so I actually prefer this way."
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- "But can't you have your freedom while also dissolving fear between
		the two? Because the way I see it, only one of you is truly free right
		now."
	</p>
	<p>
		"No, you can't. And when it is a choice between me and Them, I will
		always choose myself without hesitation. Besides, you really don't want
		to know what happens when They stop being afraid of you" he said
		mysteriously. Besides being dramatic, he always had new stories and
		gossip to tell. This night turned out to be no different. "I lost a
		friend, more of an acquaintance really, earlier this week. I kept
		telling him to keep his distance, but he ended up dying because he
		didn't stand for his own freedom."
	</p>
	<p>
		Dismissing his own warning, I did not have to ask him for elaboration;
		in fact, he became more enthused as his story progressed.
	</p>
	<p>
		"There was an unnecessarily raucous festival a few days ago, apparently
		his master went overboard and tried to force him to wear something that
		was suffocating, and he finally had enough. I had been telling him to
		speak his mind for ages, but he simply wouldn't listen" he said
		apathetically, surely enjoying the wind way more than I was in that
		moment, "He cared too much about how She would feel, while ignoring my
		uncountable reminders that in the end, They will always put themselves
		first, not him."
	</p>
	<p>
		"You are quite as self-centered as you are making Them ought to be, you
		both are also equally sharp from my observation. Are you sure you're
		not related to them?" I asked him tauntingly.
	</p>
	<p>
		He hissed agitatedly, and he rose a little indicating his fleeting
		thought of leaving but decided otherwise in the end. "I would never
		abandon my kids" he said sounding offended, "And if I was foolish
		enough to do so, I surely wouldn't kill their rescuer."
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- I wondered who chooses which occurrence or event to focus on while
		making a judgement about something? Surely there are better ways to
		reach conclusions?
	</p>
	<p>
		"Of course, if I was kidnapped in a cage, I wouldn't move my huge apish
feet to try and save someone random in the first place, so it was		<em>his</em> fault anyways for being stupid" he finished bitterly.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- "&#8230;Being stupid, for helping someone" I echoed softly, "I'm
		sorry but how do you decide who to help? And when not to?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"You help one of your own, of course. It isn't your responsibility to
		help everyone" he said, prodding me annoyedly at my lack of grasp on
		such a simple matter, "You make one mistake, and you die."
	</p>
	<p>
		I thought about the seriousness of this grave situation, staring at the
		smoke dissipating in the clear sky, making the stars flicker; all the
		houses were now hidden in darkness except the closest one; even the
		wind had gotten tired.
	</p>
	<p>
		"The worst of all is, even when They make a mistake&#8230;it is still
		you who dies. Whether it is trying to catch fish and accidently
		snatching a shark, or -"
	</p>
	<p>
		"Wait, aren't sharks dangerous?" I interjected, from my perspective, if
		you were expecting to catch a small fish and find yourself with a
		full-grown shark, the chances of you dying were much higher than those
		of the shark.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Let's save that conversation for another time" he said sliding down
		unexpectedly, "We will get rid of your incompetence on this subject
		when we meet again."
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- How often do we mistake someone's sincerity for an insult?
	</p>
	<p>
		I smiled softly, watching him shiver slightly on the dewy lawn; even
		though he was thoroughly angered tonight, I knew in the end he meant
		well. His faith in me to share his stories and thoughts was the eminent
		proof.
	</p>
	<p>
		"You are still forgetting one more ritual" I said as he started to
		trot, "One new humorous fact?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"They cover Oranges in plastic before selling them" he meowed, "You owe
		me two mice for next time! You were empty handed tonight. See you next
		week?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"I truly cannot control if I will be here, in any case, thank you" I
		said, at his persistently presumptuous question during every parting,
		with a grin as we bid farewell.

		was enjoying the frosty dark evening resting on the upper branches of
		an Oak-chestnut tree, the fluttering of leaves would sometimes give me
		a glance on the commotion happening inside a glassy walled room. Time
		would always fly while I watched the occupants on the last row work on
		their laptops, barely listening to the lecture being staged in front of
		them. I had lived on this tree for more than two years; its newest
		resident had joined me around four months ago. It took loud heaving
		sounds emitting from the branch below to break my attention.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Almost there!" I encouraged him; he wasn't always like this. And from
		the countless stories he had told me about his cousins, I suspected he
		had a problem.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Aren't you supposed to be an expert at this?" I asked, watching him
		gasp for air.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Shut&#8230;it" he said panting.
	</p>
	<p>
		After taking a moment to recover, he grabbed one of the container lids
		laying neatly at the ridge and started biting on it.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Why do you eat that?" I asked, almost repulsed, and offering him an
		almond instead.
	</p>
	<p>
		"That is what They throw out" he said shrugging, "Sometimes the things
		are very tasty, you should try them."
	</p>
	<p>
		I stayed silent, watching him throw the lid on the ground and grabbing
		a wrapper. He had taken upon himself to secure all the garbage around
		our house. I had asked him why trash instead of the usual hazelnuts, he
		said They would always take the fallen leaves and nuts away, so he had
		to dig inside garbage cans to find things.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- "It is odd isn't it, you litter nuts everywhere you go, and you said
		They litter these plastic bits everywhere They go. What is the
		difference between the two?" I asked.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Well, I only care for myself. I store them in case I run out, only to
		later forget where I kept them. They seem to care for everyone, the
		stuff They throw out is useful for me!" he said, continuing to munch on
		a newly found plastic straw.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- Which is more important: intentions or results, of the action?
	</p>
	<p>
		Due to his high regards for those around him, I didn't have the heart
		to tell him that his forgetfulness has caused the birth of more forests
		than the junk surrounding us ever will.
	</p>
	<p>
		I absorbed myself again at the classroom underneath us, They were
		almost done if the time on the closest person's computer was correct.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Don't you envy Them?" he asked, riveting his eyes on them, "They have
		so much power. They know so much&#8230;you both are a lot alike you
		know."
	</p>
	<p>
		"Is that so?" I asked, with hint of a smile, "Thank you for the
		compliment but uhm - no, there isn't a competition of knowledge. So
		need reason to get envious.
	</p>
	<p>
		"&#8230;Hey, I need a favor. Can you put me down on that wooden
		snow-covered bench?" I asked slowly after a thought.
	</p>
	<p>
		"What? No! It's not safe over there!" he remonstrated, suddenly
		flurrying into action, "Are you trying to run away? Is it something I
		have done?"
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- Is it hard to slow down thoughts when most needed? If so, why? And
		if not, how do you do it?
	</p>
	<p>
		"Listen to me" I said quietly, "I just want to try something. I will be
		right underneath your house the whole time, you can visit me every
		night."
	</p>
	<p>
		"What if the worst happens?" he asked, sounding afraid.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Well in that case, just two things" I said, crestfallen at having
		failed to erase his distress, "Stop constantly worrying about living in
		this place, the Goshawks who used to live here have long abandoned it.
		And second, thank you for everything. Is there anything you'd like to
		tell me?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"Tell Them thanks for patting my back once!" he said excitedly,
		galvanizing himself and starting to push me off the tree.
	</p>
	<p>
		I saw his bushy tail fleetingly whisk away, as I imprinted myself on
		three inches of snow with a muffled thud.

	<p>
		recollection of my meeting starts with me lying flat on the rock,
		resting lazily in a muddy swamp surrounded by a dozen young red maples.
	</p>
	<p>
		I quietly watched a large golden eagle with whitish tarsal feathers dig
		her sharp hallux-claws into threads holding me together and started
		ripping me. Before I could react in any way, I was covered in darkness
		as she stretched her massive russet pinions and landed itself on the
		lowest section of the nearest tree within two wing-beats. I continued
		to gaze silently as she combined my pieces with small twigs to build a
		mossy nest.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- Would she have torn me if she knew I could sense it? Which also
		raised a supplementary question after some thought:
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- Is having a brain a blessing or a curse?
	</p>
	<p>
		After a few days of repeated process, I was light enough for her to
		carry in her curved culmen.
	</p>
	<p>
		It turned out, she was not the only resident, her newborns were snugged
		together, examining the newest arrival from distance. It took them a
		few hours to get comfortable around me, and before long they started to
		believe I was their lunch, which, thankfully I wasn't.
	</p>
	<p>
		Several days passed in silence, I was too tired to start another
		conversation and they were unaware of my awareness, which I preferred.
		The eaglets were no more quiet fledglings, in fact the one with darkest
		plumage had started to fly. After every soar in the hazy skies, she
		would return excitedly and break in a babble with her siblings.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- If our perception of something changes from being pleasing to being
		annoying, are we attracted towards the entity or are we simply a fan of
		certain qualities?
	</p>
	<p>
		But before I had more than a few seconds to think this one through, the
		hazy skies turned ghastly dark with a cackle of thunder hidden amongst
		them. As usually was the case in these scenarios, I was left behind as
		they all left, the mother carrying the ones who still couldn't fly, to
		a higher branch.
	</p>
	<p>
		The storm started around nightfall and ended long after dawn had
		arrived. The water level had risen high enough to soak me with splashed
		raindrops. I wished they were safe. When the Sun broke out, I was
		covered in leaves and what remained of a neatly woven roost.
	</p>
	<p>
		I saw them peer down at me, I counted all the heads, surveying from
		atop and debating among themselves if I should be used again, but it
		appeared that I was dismissed that day as they rose to gather sticks
		and stems from nearby bushes. What mesmerized me, was their eyes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- Why did I see no remorse, no sadness or any sign of fatigue when
		they saw their hard work demolished by no fault of their own?
	</p>
	<p>
		It took a whole week for them to conclude I was not soggy, and swoop me
		up to their nest, this time carried by a much softer beak.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- "How great is it, to fly high within the clouds? How does it feel?"
		I asked one night to the mother when the young ones were dozed off.
	</p>
	<p>
		"It teaches us humility&#8230;to realize how small we are compared to
		the vast lands" she chittered softly after a pause, before drifting to
		sleep herself.

	<p>
		do you work so hard?" I asked, looking at him wiping his forehead with
		a grimy hand. It was past noon and lunch, which I was resting on, was
		long overdue, "You know you promised we'd be back home by evening."
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- What are the things that make you forget your appetite?
	</p>
	<p>
		"I also promised myself to at least finish this side before nightfall,
		and the speed at which I'm going there's a high chance I'm not going to
		make it" he said dispiritedly, arcing his back backwards to feel the
		Sun glaring at him, he sighed for a moment and resumed plowing.
	</p>
	<p>
		I did not persist on the primary unanswered question, his dedication to
		finish the self-assigned task dampened my desire for a conversation. I
		quietly watched his shadow reappear from the Lahaina noon and progress
		slowly towards me while he continued digging the barren land. It wasn't
		until nightfall that he started to make his way back.
	</p>
	<p>
		"You know, if not for that deer when we arrived, we would have been
		home quite some time ago" he said, "You got sidetrack for hours."
	</p>
	<p>
		He sat down and laid me on his lap, removed the cloth, and started
		eating hungrily without a single thought of cleaning his hands.
	</p>
	<p>
		After a few mouthfuls, he replied "I wasn't sidetracked. The whole
		purpose of all this is what we did earlier this morning."
	</p>
	<p>
		"You're spending day after day just to help random herd of deer?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"Not just them. But everything else that lives" he said, now opening
		his bottle, I noticed he only took a miniature swig.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- "Surely not everything?" I asked, "What about something dangerous?
		Like a tiger?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"Do you remember the day that we met?" he asked slowly.
	</p>
	<p>
		"You were planting bamboos, and I had washed ashore. What about it?" I
		said, flummoxed at his mention of a memory more than a decade old.
	</p>
	<p>
		"They were for the snakes. To avoid the heat-strokes" he said.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- "Why help those who hurt you?" I asked bewildered. He was different
		from others, I thought to myself.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Same reason horses run when we whip them, it is in my nature" he said,
		taking another bite at stony piece of bread, "They don't strike with
		intent of inflicting damage, but more in regards of not receiving it.
		It is an act of self-defense. Sometimes hunger."
	</p>
	<p>
		I tried to connect the analogy of horse-racing with assisting animals,
		but it was taking too long, so I stowed away the puzzle for later.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- "Why so much care and regard for animals? They aren't anything like
		you from what I've been told."
	</p>
	<p>
		He replied looking morosely at me, "I wish to meet some of the people
		you have met."
	</p>
	<p>
		I let him enjoy his lunch (morphed into dinner), while he stared at the
		unfinished mounds of dirt.
	</p>
	<p>
		"I was walking through the town once" he stated randomly, "and I came
		across the strangest scene. A stray dog had a young macaque checking
		him for fleas. One night few months ago, I came across another peculiar
		story. A dolphin, which was trained to retrieve litter in return for
		meals, was breaking bits of paper into smaller pieces to receive more
		fish. I only founded out recently that the technology used in
		submarines to navigate is discovered from Bats. And the latest case I
		came across was that of a raccoon -"
	</p>
	<p>
		"Hold on, wait - what are you trying to explain?" I asked alarmed at
		the sudden flare.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Animals are smart" he stated, "And their behavior is synonymous to
		ours: we care for only the things we find useful or that fits our
		description of 'beauty'. Anything that has mind of its own, much like
		ours, or that doesn't have an immediate relevance to us is discarded
		and deemed useless."
	</p>
	<p>
		"Well, to be fair, it <em>is</em> useless, isn't it? What is the harm
		in getting rid of that serves no purpose?" I repeated the rhetorical
		question I was asked ages ago.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Since when did something that serves no purpose to us translate to its
		worthiness of survival?" he asked wryly, laughing while watching the
		dirt between his feet, forgetting his meal "I believe we aren't here to
		make a sculpture out of a tree. We are simply one branch out of
		thousands. And every time we cut one branch off, whether we visibly
		notice it immediately or not, it affects us all."
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- Why do some people talk in analogies? Although highly
		thought-provoking, is it hard to sometimes find the perfect metaphor? I
		wonder.
	</p>
	<p>
		"How do you know it affects you?" I said.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Because it is in human nature to realize the importance of something
		only after it has been lost. It was only after the oysters died out
		that we noticed the waters getting dirtier, it took several experiments
		to study the significance of wolves in some foreign national park's
		ecosystem. And the most recent example are bees" he finished
		disgruntledly, emptying his food container.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- "So, what are you doing about this?" I asked curiously.
	</p>
	<p>
		"The only thing I know how to do: plant trees. I want to create a safe
		habitat for wild-life. No matter what it takes" he said bracingly.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was taught laws on probability before this meeting transpired, so I
		chose to warn him:
	</p>
	<p>
		"The way I see it, there isn't much one person can do about this
		problem."
	</p>
	<p>
		"Yeah, well&#8230;I rather try and fail than fail to try" he said
		candidly, smacking his hands together and getting up, "Let's go home?
		It is almost time to go to bed."
	</p>
	<p>
		"You know Molai, you remind me a lot of an old friend" I said after
		watching him drink the remaining water and stretch.
	</p>
	<p>
		"What was he like?" he asked.
	</p>
	<p>
		"I don't remember much, only a line comes to mind right now. We were
		sitting by a log-fire on one autumn evening, I pointed at the swarm of
		mosquitos chasing its luminosity and in exchange kept getting burnt, he
		filled a nearby pot with water and extinguished the flames. At my
		inquisitive look, he replied: "God forbid that I should build a fire
		for my comfort, that should be the means of destroying any of His
		creatures.""
	</p>
	<p>
		"I really do wish to meet some of the people you've met" he said
		shaking his head as we started our journey back home.

		kids between the age of eight and twenty-two. I love them. I am a firm
		believer" he said, looking at the setting Sun on a silky-smooth beach
		with traffic honking behind him. "They are our leaders and they will
		show us the way."
	</p>
	<p>
		The crashing of the waves was not completely muffling the clamor of the
		cars and motorcycles, but it did create an incomprehensible wall
		between the street and the ocean; the air felt purer.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- "Why is that? How are they different?" I asked, laying on his lap,
		every now and then being ruffled by the sand being carried in the
		breeze.
	</p>
	<p>
		"It is easier for them to change than the grown-ups" he replied. "It is
		also easier for them to do the right thing."
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- Asking "Is 22 not a grown-up" seemed secondary, a more important
		question would have been "How do you know what the 'right thing' is?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"You still haven't gotten help huh, from the administration" I said
		darkly. "I'm sorry."
	</p>
	<p>
		"Don't be. Not your fault. You've done enough" he said crossly, "When
		there was only me, you stayed at my side to strengthen my grit. It is
		I, who has failed."
	</p>
	<p>
		"If I have done enough, you surely have" I said, trying to reason and
		shift his guilt, "You have tried harder than I have. I have witnessed
		the atrocity of those opposing you, it is them who has failed."
	</p>
	<p>
		He didn't have anything to say, perhaps he wasn't completely listening
		to me. His eyes were set far within the brim of the horizon, now
		glowing red.
	</p>
	<p>
		"I saw a swan once. She was carrying her newborns on her back.
		Selflessly. I wondered if that is how our planet takes care of us. If I
		can't take care of her in return, it is no one else's but my own
		failure" he said confidently, "And that is okay."
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- "Who teaches people the definition of success? What or who crafted
		yours?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"I don't know. For some, it's the society. For others, their parents
		and family" he said distractedly, "Why the question though?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"Oh nothing, just wondering" I said, thinking almost to myself,
		"Success seems&#8230;important.
	</p>
	<p>
		"You mentioned people who are younger are easier to change. I saw quite
		a few ten-year-old helping you quite enthusiastically, to them - they
		surely succeeded?" I asked after a few minutes.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Point being?" he said, looking at other families making their way back
		to their cars.
	</p>
	<p>
		"It appeared as if you created what success means for them. Which is
		simply to try&#8230;and, to care" I added as an afterthought.
	</p>
	<p>
		"I care out of selfishness" he said sniggering sadly, "I have come with
		a very selfish need of mine, which is to protect my planet.
	</p>
	<p>
		"I thought I could do it. Shake people out of apathy. But I couldn't."
		he sighed, "It is easier to set a spark in kids than adults."
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- "Why is it hard to <em>change</em> what success means to you?" I
		wondered, "And how detrimental are primary "misguided" impressions?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"Well, I tried" he said shaking his head and dusting his hands, "For
		two years. Time to give up."
	</p>
	<p>
		"What does success mean to you?" I finally asked.
	</p>
	<p>
		"My mother once told me, you've limited time on this planet. Make it
		count. She told me to do something worthwhile every time we walked on
		this beach. Strangely I became attached to it, and nature has a whole"
		he said softly, turning to look at me from the kid kicking a ball
		across the park. "Why do you ask?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"Well, I was thinking&#8230;what did you tell the kids? To make them
		join you?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"Instead of telling kids about fairytales of imagination, I rather talk
		more about the beauties of nature, there is enough magic in the real
		world. Maybe then they will work harder to protect it" he recited.
	</p>
	<p>
		"But it only works on kids. Not adults" he finished, finally setting
		his eyes back on the soft reflections of the tremulous lights by now
		sunken Sun.
	</p>
	<p>
		I wished there was something I could do to lessen the pain as I looked
		at the demoralized face of once an avid activist.
	</p>
	<p>
		"You know, an old friend of mine once told me: Adults are just kids who
		are grown up. Maybe just try something different" I suggested.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Alright&#8230;I'll see" he said unconvinced, "Let's get going."
	</p>
	<p>
		Our walk from the Versova Beach was as entertaining as any other day.
		With tourists enjoying the local cuisine at portable stalls, residents
		chattering about the latest celebrity gossip while sitting on old
		benches and teenagers whizzing by us on roller blades, there was plenty
		of commotion to keep me occupied, and to keep him deep in his thought.
	</p>
	<p>
		It wasn't until we reached home that he asked me, "Did your
		friend&#8230;succeed?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"That depends on his definition" I said playfully mockingly, "But yes,
		it wasn't easy by any means. But neither is what you are doing Afroz."
	</p>
	<p>
		He laughed and took off his gloves before stepping into shower. I
		thought to myself before closing for the day, "Someone(thing) caused a
		very peculiar definition of 'selfish' in him."

		you going to tell me why I can't just take you with me?" she asked
		anxiously for the umpteenth time, lodging me out from the gap between
		concrete ledge and an iron clad wooden bench, "One of these days,
		someone will find you."
	</p>
	<p>
		"I have promised a friend I would stay here" I said, "in case he needs
		me, I cannot abandon him."
	</p>
	<p>
		"You know someone else besides me from this campus?" she asked
		incredulously, stopping on her tracks from going indoors, "Who? Who is
		it?!"
	</p>
	<p>
		"The probability of you being able to converse with him is close to
		zero" I said almost laughing.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Fine&#8230;" she said sounding hurt, as she took the seat nearest the
		window showcasing city's skyline.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Oh, I have to tell you! We went on a family trip to Tnerb crater! It
		is one thing to read about them, and quite another to see them with our
		own eyes. I was in awe just looking at that pond and trying to wrap my
		head around the fact that it was created by a stone of that size!" she
		said excitedly, "And can you just imagine that our planet is littered
		with craters much bigger than this?"
	</p>
	<p>
		That word struck an earlier conversation with someone else, so I asked,
		"What is it that you learn here?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"Changing topics from the usual, are we?" she asked, eyeing me, "Why
		the question?"
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- "Why are you cautious around some question and not others?" is what
		I wanted to ask, but that would have diverted our conversation,
		something I found her to be remarkable at.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Not an accusation" I answered laughingly, "I am sure you learn plenty,
		but it looks like we just never got around to discuss the topic of your
		studies. Also, it seems partial that I know so much about your social
		affairs and not academics.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Fine, ugh, wait here" she said, strapping off her bag on the adjacent
		seat, "If we're going to talk about studies, I'm going to need coffee."
	</p>
	<p>
		I watched the timely automatic street lamps buzzed on as the autumn Sun
		set behind a largely glossy building. She returned fumbling inside her
		purse, with the other hand holding a steamy cup wrapped with a
		cardboard colored sleeve.
	</p>
	<p>
		"So&#8230;before I tell you what I study, it is important to know why"
		she said briskly after the first sip, "I am the first generation in my
		family to attend a college, not to mention I am a girl."
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- "Wait, why does gender play a role in studies?" I asked.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Haha, it will take me a whole book to answer that question" she said
		rolling her eyes, "Anyways, me being the person I am, wanted to prove
		myself. I had to choose a career that was rewarding."
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- "What is 'rewarding' for you?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"A degree that pays well! Field that is in demand" she said with an
		expression of someone adding two and two.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- "How does 'wanting to prove' oneself translate to getting a job with
		big salary?" I didn't know, but it was clear that she would have gotten
		annoyed if I had asked.
	</p>
	<p>
		Instead, I decided to press on something else.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- "So college is the place to gain information to get better jobs?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"This is the place to gain any kind of information you want, not just
		to get better jobs. They teach everything. From peace to war, our
		successes and failures. Some of the things are biased, some aren't."
		she said indifferently, taking another sip, "If you are interested in
		knowledge, the library has more books than you can read in a lifetime."
	</p>
	<p>
		At this, I was taken back to the cold night few months ago, watching a
		classroom session from bird's-eye. Now I wished I could change my
		answer.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- "What do students do with the information?" I asked, recalling the
		conversation.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Well, they have the <em>potential </em>to tackle world-wide problems"
		she said with an emphasis, "but truth be told, everyone's just absorbed
		in their own lives. Some do go on to do big things, but most only use
		part of what they've learned, mainly the part that is required in their
		jobs. Rest is deemed 'useless' and forgotten as time moves on" she
		finished sardonically.
	</p>
	<p>
		"What?" she asked at my bemused expression.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- "What guilty conscience, or expectations, made you phrase your
		answer in such a way? All I wanted to know was if their experience here
		was worth it, and how efficient was the learning process" I explained
		calmly.
	</p>
	<p>
		"It's fine&#8230;just leave it. The issues we face today are too big to
		tackle by people like us anyways" she said, almost to herself as she
		stared in the depths of her cup, "Best to just handle our life."
	</p>
	<p>
		"That reminds me of a conversation I had with a friend long time ago, I
		told her almost the exact same thing" I said, "when she kept rambling
		on."
	</p>
	<p>
		"What did she say?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"'The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they
		don't have any'" I said shortly.
	</p>
	<p>
		We both sat in silence, me looking up at the marvelous sky-scrapers
		above the shimmering city lights, while she leaned back with closed
		eyes.
	</p>
	<p>
		"What can I do?" she asked, looking at me seriously and taking the last
		gulp from the now cold drink.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Start with something small. And learn from it. Find a way, or create
		one, for people to separate trash by edible, non-edible and any other
		means you see fit, it will help with re-using and decomposing it" I
		said, thinking about my branch partner, "And if you can think of any
		way to help the birds and squirrels living on campus, that would be
		great too."
	</p>
	<p>
		"Why?" she asked startled, "What's wrong with them?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"I guess it is time you meet the reason why you've to put me securely
		by that bench every night before you go home" I said genially,
		"Remember to be gentle, and oh, he loves to get patted."
	</p>
	<p>
		"Wha- I'm lost, it's okay let's just go! It's about time I got some
		answers" she said excitedly, whipping her lips on the cuffs of her
		sleeve, as she threw the cup and the unused napkins in a plastic bin
		labeled 'Recycle', "one more thing, it was you who side-tracked this
		time. We will discuss my Major later."

		if you want to come, this is the only way. I'm not taking entire you to
		the restaurant; I'd look like an idiot" he replied irritably, "Why do
		you want to come anyways? I don't even want to go to this stupid
		thing."
	</p>
	<p>
		"Why not?" I asked, "You've been brooding for days to go to
		restaurant."
	</p>
	<p>
		"Yeah but not with family!" in a tone that suggested it was I should
		have known it all along, "It's so embarrassing!"
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- "Who decides what is embarrassing? And more importantly, Why?" I
		wanted to ask, but it would have jeopardized my involvement in the
		trip.
	</p>
	<p>
		It took a lot of egging on from me and his family to have him step
		outside the house that Friday evening. I thought his temperament would
		improve in the journey, but the car ride mainly consisted eye-rolls at
		every syllable uttered from the front seats, so I figured it would be
		best if I stayed silent.
	</p>
	<p>
		"What is this place?!" he asked in an outrage, the moment everyone
		stepped out of the car, "You didn't tell me we were going to a shack!
		How will I look sitting in here?! Ugh, I'm not eating here."
	</p>
	<p>
		From what he later described, the place was no bigger than an elongated
		joint.
	</p>
	<p>
		As we made our way inside, I expected majority of the dinner to be
		eaten in silence that day with his parents giving up after numerous
		ineffectual efforts to exchange pleasantries. Wanting to avoid the
		awkwardness, I busied myself with pondering on (rather boringly) the
		topic of food preferences.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- Why is everyone so unique? Ranging from different textures to food
		palates, is there any one flavor that is superior to others? And what
		decides the favorite type of cuisine that we grow with? Most important
		of all, why do these favorites change?
	</p>
	<p>
		Buried in my thoughts, I failed to grasp the change in atmosphere as we
		stepped out with full stomachs and rather loud chatter. I did notice
		the animation in his voice as we drove back home but decided not to
		intrude upon their family time.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Sooo I'm guessing the food wasn't so bad after all?" I asked after
		several minutes of complete silence once we were back in his room; me
		slanted besides a lava lamp set on the nightstand while he sat with his
		arms crossed under his head, staring at the muted ceiling on his bed.
	</p>
	<p>
		He chuckled after a delay, "Haha&#8230;I completely forgot how the food
		was."
	</p>
	<p>
		"Huh? How? You just ate! Uhh, are you alright?" I asked uncertainly.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Better than ever." he said quietly with a minuscule grin, eyes still
		fixed vertically, "Just a lot of thinking to do."
	</p>
	<p>
		"I'm all ears."
	</p>
	<p>
		"We aren't so logical" he began abruptly, "At least, not as much as I
		thought."
	</p>
	<p>
		"And how do you come to that conclusion?" I asked, wondering how much
		can change in a mere few hours.
	</p>
	<p>
		"All my life, I had thought we think with our brains, that we are the
		smartest, and we use our smartness to make decisions. But today I was
		proven wrong" he said with a chuckle; for a person who was just proven
		wrong, he seemed to be in a great mood.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- Do people like when they prove themselves wrong? If so, what is the
		harm if someone else does it?
	</p>
	<p>
		"I am sorry, but this doesn't help" I sighed, a bit unnerved now, "Can
		you please start from the top? Truth be told, right after we entered
		the trattoria."
	</p>
	<p>
		He started, "We went in, and I was still in a bad mood, which, now that
		I think about it, was stupid" he added uneasily, "and we sat at the
		farthest corner because I didn't want to risk being seen by my
		colleagues in such a place. We were all silent and it was actually my
		sister who broke the tension."
	</p>
	<p>
		"What did she say?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"&#8230;She cried. They gave her a menu which she could use" his said
		throatily, "&#8230;it had braille."
	</p>
	<p>
		We didn't continue for the next few minutes, it was at moments like
		these, when I wish more than ever that I could be one of you.
	</p>
	<p>
		"How does that equate with humans not being logical?" I asked, breaking
		the trance.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Well how many people do you think visit that restaurant a day? And
		what percentage of them require such an addition to the menu?" he
		asked.
	</p>
	<p>
		"I'd say, not many in this period."
	</p>
	<p>
		"Exactly!" he said excitedly, turning towards me, "And how much do you
		think it costed them to make those menus? Mind you, they don't even
		need a menu with the amount of variety they have!" he said laughing,
		"Yet, they still went one step ahead than all the other places&#8230;so
		we met the owner.
	</p>
	<p>
		"He said he didn't care about the money, he just wanted everyone to
		have a good time. We asked if he knew anyone - you know, and he said
		no. Usually people like these have had personal experience. It's just
		so odd&#8230;I've never seen an act of kindness like this. Up until
		now, I figured everyone everywhere was materialistic."
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- Dang, Isn't that a huge generalization? I wonder what something made
		you theorize that?
	</p>
	<p>
		"I mean I know better now!" he said scrupulously, "But all - no wait,
		most - !"
	</p>
	<p>
		"Most?" I asked skeptically.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Okay okay!" The people <em>I</em> have met" he continued with an
		emphasis, "usually care only for the money. And themselves." he added
		as an after-thought.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- Why is that you think?
	</p>
	<p>
		"I don't know but I am not about to make the same mistake again and
		group everyone in the same boat!" he said slyly, "I will tell you some
		experiences later; the important thing after tonight is: my faith in
		humanity is restored" he finished with a content smile.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- I wanted to ask, "What event forsook it?" but felt it would dampen
		his energy. Instead, I asked: So, what now?
	</p>
	<p>
		"I'm going back to that place. This time with friends" he said, now
		positively sitting on his bed, with the phone receiver already in his
		hands, "I want to help the family running it. It's people like him, who
		are trying to change the world, who need our help."
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- I wonder if he really does think that way? That his actions are
		'changing the world'? Besides, for every hundred places, you may find
		one similar to your recent visit, is the world really changing?
	</p>
	<p>
		"Yeah&#8230;you know what, every journey begins with one step. He is
		simply doing what he feels is right, he isn't thinking about changing
		the whole world. I've lost too much time being negative, I don't want
		to take that mentality to my grave, it is about time I started to hope
		again. I will never forget that radiant expression on my sister's
		face&#8230;it was a perfect present for my Dad getting hired" he said,
		wiping on his sleeves.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- I couldn't think of anything to reply, until one thought crossed my
		mind: It is odd isn't it? That you found such joy and happiness in
		something illogical and emotion driven, while using your 'intellect'
		only got you away from those close to you?
	</p>
	<p>
		"I learned something else important today" he ended laughingly, "don't
		judge a book by its cover" he said with a wink, as he started to dial.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a name="_Hlk526373544">
			Everyone likes to change the world, but no one wants to change
			themselves. -Well, clearly not 'no one'.
		</a>
	</p>
	<p>
		I try to keep my requests to a minimum, but I must plead: if it is
		possible for you, it would mean the most to be transcribed in braille.

		wish I was not born in this era" she sighed.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- Why? What is so bad about it?
	</p>
	<p>
		"Where to begin?!" she replied aggravatedly raising her arms high, "The
		world is rotting! The land is becoming barren. The Sahelian winds are
		making it harder and harder to stay outside, not to mention grown-ups
		arguing like kids! I thought it would all end after we broke off but
		guess not. And to top it all off, the biggest of the problem is me" she
		ended glumly, slouching down on the table with her arms folded
		underneath her chin.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Meaning" I asked puzzled.
	</p>
	<p>
		It took her a few moments, as she stared outside the window, before she
		started, "I get attached to things too easily. Way too quickly. While
		everyone takes the more logical route, I get too involved into my
		emotions and end up creating more trouble than necessary."
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- How much trouble really is necessary to live? I also wonder what it
		means to get <em>too </em>into emotions.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Other humans don't get attached?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"They do! But to things that matter. Ever since I was little, I used to
		care too much for the silliest things" she said disappointedly, "You
		saw, didn't you? How I spent hours trying to catch that one golden
		little cute fish and let it go instead of taking it?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"Well I think the conundrum arises in how you describe them" I nudged
		with a small smile, "Why do you think it is cute to begin with?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"Ugh, I don't know&#8230;don't ask me such questions!" she retorted
		crossly, then quickly pouring out her annoyance "but if I hadn't spent
		hours on that cavity filled baobab tree with Shiro, we wouldn't have
		met. You do realize, that right?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"Where's Shiro now? I haven't seen her in a while!" I implored,
		"Besides, I thought that was your home?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"I already told you, everything is drying up. We had to move West.
		There was nothing but obstacles for us over there" she had reduced back
		into the hollow tone, "What was worse is the endless quarrels between
		the Heads, half wanted to move South, including Shiro and her family,
		and another half towards other civilizations due to rumors about some
		new inventions. Well, I hope they had better luck than us. Since over
		here, we've had nothing but more trouble."
	</p>
	<p>
		"Is the water supply not adequate? Or is there a problem with creating
		proper tools?" I asked, "I thought you already took care of the food
		scarcity."
	</p>
	<p>
		"Yes yes, and I thank you for helping me out with that" she replied
		dismissively, waving her hand "but the new problem was the pack of
		lions."
	</p>
	<p>
		"But didn't you mention that one of them was your friend? And you used
		to sneak down near the valley just to watch him?" I asked fearing her
		answer.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Uh huh&#8230;he was just so white and fluffy though! You don't see
		most like them around here though, most are rest orangish with a bronze
		tint" she said with perking up at once, then giggling a little "He was
		so timid too! Kind of reminds me of myself when I was little&#8230;but
		it all turned sideways the moment I mentioned it to my mother last
		night" she ended ruefully.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Well that was for your safety, they may be dangerous." I explained.
	</p>
	<p>
		"&#8230;I think I made a huge mistake though." she said defeated, upon
		my questioned look, she went on, "Because they weren't really hurting
		us, were they? Besides, they were here first, I am sure of it. I told
		my mother and she relayed the whole story to my father. Him and others
		went in the middle of the night, first to that waterway, then around
		the neighboring hills. They didn't come home until near morning, with a
		somber news that delighted the whole town.
	</p>
	<p>
		"All I had left was you and him&#8230;" she cried, gazing out at the
		windy scene at a flock of lilac-rollers, which chirped its way back to
		its nest, "And now I am sure I lost him as well."
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- Why do you feel regret though? Could you have predicted their
		actions?
	</p>
	<p>
		"The reason for regret is that I know these people, I should have
		considered their reactions before telling them everything" she answered
		tentatively.
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- How much ignorance, do you think, is optional in this world and can
		be eliminated simply by choice?
	</p>
	<p>
		Q- Well, what will you do now?
	</p>
	<p>
		"I&#8230;I don't know" she said after a pause, "One thing is for
		certain, those lions, these birds, and us - all live for the same
		purpose, to take care of each other. We all share sadness and laughter.
		We all feel pain and joy. I need to know I didn't make a terrible
		mistake back there. I need to figure some things out."
	</p>
	<p>
		"And uhh, how are you planning on doing that?" I asked trying to keep
		up with her train of thought.
	</p>
	<p>
		"By trying to learn, I am moving North. I heard people there are
		developing some sort of new way of communication, a smarter way to
		track our thoughts and discussions using letters and scriptures; if
		there is an answer, I will find it there" she concluded resolutely,
		putting me aside, and striding out in the beautifully magenta evening
		perched upon tenuous clouds.
	</p>
	<p>
		As she was stepping out, I shouted "You really do seem determined to
		follow your goal to &#173;&#173;&#822; &#822; !"
